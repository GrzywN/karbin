# Why Vim might be a better choice than famous VS Code

As software developers, we all have our own preferences when it comes to text editors. Some prefer the simplicity of Notepad, while others swear by the power and flexibility of IDEs like Visual Studio. However, one text editor that often goes overlooked in these discussions is Vim.

Vim, short for Vi Improved, is a command-line based text editor that has been around for over 30 years. It may not have the sleek user interface of VS Code, but it more than makes up for it with its powerful features and customization options.

One of the biggest advantages of Vim is its modal nature. Unlike traditional text editors, Vim operates in two modes: normal and insert. Normal mode is used for navigating and manipulating text, while insert mode is used for typing. This allows for faster and more efficient editing, as you can perform actions like deleting or copying text without having to switch to a different tool or menu.

Another advantage of Vim is its extensibility. Vim is highly configurable and can be customized to suit your specific needs. You can install plugins to add new functionality, or create your own custom commands and macros. This allows you to tailor Vim to your specific workflow and make it work the way you want it to.

Vim also has a steeper learning curve than VS Code, but once you master it, you'll be able to edit text faster and more efficiently. The community around Vim is also very active and helpful, and there are many resources available to help you learn and improve your skills.

In conclusion, while VS Code may be more popular and user-friendly, Vim is a powerful and flexible text editor that can be customized to suit your specific needs. If you're willing to put in the time to learn it, Vim can be a better choice than VS Code.
